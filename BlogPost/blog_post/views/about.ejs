                        <p>Welcome to my blog! This space was created as part of a school project, but it’s also a place where I can share ideas, opinions, and creative work. I wanted to build something that feels personal, thoughtful, and engaging—not just another assignment.</p>

                        <p>On this blog, you’ll find a mix of reflections, projects, and topics that interest me. Whether it’s analysis, storytelling, or exploring new concepts, my goal is to write content that’s clear, honest, and worth reading.</p>

                        <p>Thank you for visiting and taking the time to explore my work. I hope you find something here that makes you think, smile, or learn something new.</p>
